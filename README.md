I am learning Full Stack development.
Here I post my progress in my studies and projects that I have implemented.

This is my **first** js practice project.

This project is the crown of my creations so far.
Technologies here: HTML, CSS, JS, BEM and FlexBox!

Many thanks to the designer for this layout. It was a lot of fun and interesting to do it!

That's all! Smile and work in your spare time!
